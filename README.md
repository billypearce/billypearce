# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Billy Pearce.

I program servers for a manufacturing company, and I like to program my personal projects in Rust.
I like to learn every day, and have made the conscious decision to reject the use of AI coding tools while I
continue to learn and hone my skills. Concentration and struggle will payoff much more than the
instant gratification of an LLM.

## My Work

Most of my work on GitHub includes coding projects from my time in school, however my latest project, 
[Rust Web Chat](https://github.com/billypearce/rust-web-chat), is a solo project I wrote to teach 
myself some more about writing web apps and to practice my Rust programming.

## My Interests

### Programming

- Full Stack Web Dev
- Audio DSP
- Game Engines

### Other Stuff

- Guitar and Music Production
- Rock Climbing
- Astronomy
