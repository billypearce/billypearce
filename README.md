# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Billy Pearce.

I am a recent graduate from Sam Houston State University with a degree in software engineering. 
I'm currently pursuing a job as a full stack engineer.

## About My Work

Most of my work on GitHub includes coding projects from my time in school, however my latest project, 
[Rust Web Chat](https://github.com/billypearce/rust-web-chat), is a solo project I wrote to teach 
myself some more about writing web apps and to practice my Rust programming.
